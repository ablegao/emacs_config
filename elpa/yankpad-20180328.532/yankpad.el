;;; Commentary:

;; A way to insert text snippets from an org-mode file.  The org-mode file in
;; question is defined in `yankpad-file' and is set to "yankpad.org" in your
;; `org-directory' by default.  In this file, each heading specifies a snippet
;; category and each subheading of that category defines a snippet.  This way
;; you can have different yankpads for different occasions.
;;
;; You can open your `yankpad-file' by using `yankpad-edit' (or just open it in
;; any other way).  Another way to add new snippets is by using
;; `yankpad-capture-snippet', which will add a snippet to the current
;; `yankpad-category'.
;;
;; If you have yasnippet installed, yankpad will try to use it when pasting
;; snippets.  This means that you can use the features that yasnippet provides
;; (tab stops, elisp, etc).  You can use yankpad without yasnippet, and then the
;; snippet will simply be inserted as is.
;;
;; You can also add keybindings to snippets, by setting an `org-mode' tag on the
;; snippet.  The last tag will be interpreted as a keybinding, and the snippet
;; can be run by using `yankpad-map' followed by the key.  `yankpad-map' is not
;; bound to any key by default.
;;
;; Another functionality is that snippets can include function calls, instead of
;; text.  In order to do this, the snippet heading should have a tag named
;; "func".  The snippet name could either be the name of the elisp function that
;; should be executed (will be called without arguments), or the content of the
;; snippet could be an `org-mode' src-block, which will then be executed when
;; you use the snippet.
;;
;; If you name a category to a major-mode name, that category will be switched
;; to when you change major-mode.  If you have projectile installed, you can also
;; name a categories to the same name as your projecile projects, and they will
;; be switched to when using `projectile-find-file'.  These snippets will be
;; appended to your active snippets if you change category.
;;
;; To insert a snippet from the yankpad, use `yankpad-insert' or
;; `yankpad-expand'.  `yankpad-expand' will look for a keyword at point, and
;; expand a snippet with a name starting with that word, followed by
;; `yankpad-expand-separator' (a colon by default).  If you need to change the
;; category, use `yankpad-set-category'.  If you want to append snippets from
;; another category (basically having several categories active at the same
;; time), use `yankpad-append-category'.  If you have company-mode enabled,
;; you can also use `company-yankpad`.
;;
;; A quick way to add short snippets with a keyword is to add a descriptive list
;; to the category in your `yankpad-file'.  The key of each item in the list will be
;; the keyword, and the description will be the snippet.  You can turn off this
;; behaviour by setting `yankpad-descriptive-list-treatment' to nil, or change
;; descriptive lists to use `abbrev-mode' by setting the variable to 'abbrev
;; instead.
;;
;; For further customization, please see the Github page: https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad
;;
;; Here's an example of what yankpad.org could look like:

;;; Yankpad example:

;; * Category 1
;; ** Snippet 1
;;
;;    This is a snippet.
;;
;; ** snip2: Snippet 2
;;
;;    This is another snippet.  This snippet can be expanded by first typing "snip2" and
;;    then executing the `yankpad-expand' command.
;;    \* Org-mode doesn't like lines beginning with *
;;    Typing \* at the beginning of a line will be replaced with *
;;
;;    If yanking a snippet into org-mode, this will respect the
;;    current tree level by default.  Set the variable
;;    `yankpad-respect-current-org-level' to nil in order to change that.
;;
;; * Category 2
;;
;;   Descriptive lists at the top-level of a category will be treated as
;;   snippets.  You can set them to be treated as `abbrev-mode' abbrevs instead,
;;   by setting `yankpad-descriptive-list-treatment' to abbrev.
;;
;;   - name :: Erik Sjöstrand
;;   - key :: Typing "key" followed by `yankpad-expand' will insert this snippet.
;;
;; ** Snippet 1
;;
;;    This is yet another snippet, in a different category.
;; ** Snippet 2        :s:
;;
;;    This snippet will be bound to "s" when using `yankpad-map'.  Let's say you
;;    bind `yankpad-map' to f7, you can now press "f7 s" to insert this snippet.
;;
;; ** magit-status          :func:
;; ** Run magit-status      :func:m:
;;    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;    (magit-status)
;;    #+END_SRC
;;
;; * org-mode
;; ** Snippet 1
;;    This category will be switched to automatically when visiting an org-mode buffer.
;;
;; * Category 3
;;   :PROPERTIES:
;;   :INCLUDE:  Category 1|Category 2
;;   :END:
;; ** A snippet among many!
;;    This category will include snippets from Category 1 and Category 2.
;;    This is done by setting the INCLUDE property of the category.
;;
;; * Global category       :global:
;; ** Always available
;;    Snippets in a category with the :global: tag are always available for expansion.
